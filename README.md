Console-Simulator-Mod
=====================

This mod makes minecraft feel more like a console game

Currently Features:
- Limits fps to 30 for a more cinematic experience.
- None of this mod is configurable, just like a console is supposed to be
- Config added with message "Did you really think there would be a config? pffft... only PC gamers need configs" in case you forgot
